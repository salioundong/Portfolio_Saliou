                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p class="fs-4">
                    It was as part an academic project and I had to carry out a concrete mobile application
                    development project. The application is <b>CRUDL</b> type and I did: 
                    <ul class="fs-4">
                        <li>Design (data model, user interfaces, architecture)</li>
                        <li>Programming (logic, user interfaces, database)</li>
                        <li>Documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="fs-4">
                    I played with the authentification as can be seen with the image next to it.
                    And for each entity that I had to do, I implemented the creation of the entity,
                    the modification, the reading as well as its deletion from the list abd the
                    database hence the CRUDL type.
                </p><br>

                <p class="fs-4">
                    I had to learn <a class="text-decoration-none" target="_blank" href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>
                    which is an open source mobile application framework created by <b>Facebook</b>. For my native gateway, I used
                    <a href="https://expo.dev/" class="text-decoration-none" target="_blank">Expo</a>
                    and the mobile application <b>Expo Go</b> to test my code on my mobile device
